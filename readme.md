# Task Management Project

A **lightweight, Python-based task management system** that blends **database efficiency** with the simplicity of **Markdown**. This project is designed to offer flexible, powerful task management through both **SQLite** and **plain-text file integration**, making it ideal for those who prefer **customizable workflows** over rigid third-party tools.  

This project is a hands-on exercise to deepen my Python skills, while building something **practical** and **expandable** for real-world use.

## üöÄ Features

- **Effortless Database Setup:** Quickly initialize your SQLite database with `db_init.py`.
- **Full CRUD Operations:** Create, read, update, and delete tasks with intuitive scripts (`task_import_db.py`, `task_update_db.py`, `task_delete.py`).
- **Markdown Integration:** Generate and parse Markdown task entries with `task_creator.py` and `task_parser.py`‚Äîperfect for linking tasks to notes.
- **Version Control Support:** Track changes in task files using simple Git utilities (`git_file_change.py`).
- **Modular Architecture:** Easily extend or customize functionalities using `model.py`.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

1. **Initialize the Database:**  
   Run `db_init.py` to set up your SQLite database.
   
   ```bash
   python db_init.py
   ```

2. **Add or Update Tasks:**  
   Use `task_import_db.py` to add new tasks, or `task_update_db.py` to modify existing ones.

   ```bash
   python task_import_db.py
   python task_update_db.py
   ```

3. **Delete Tasks:**  
   Remove tasks from the database with `task_delete.py`.

   ```bash
   python task_delete.py
   ```

4. **Customize and Expand:**  
   Extend task behavior or structure through `model.py` for tailored workflows.

## üîß Project Vision & Roadmap

The ultimate goal is to create a **hybrid task management system** that merges the **robustness of databases** with the **flexibility of plain-text files**. It will support **Markdown-based task management**, integrating seamlessly with **note-taking applications** (like Obsidian), while maintaining **version control** through Git for transparent tracking.

### Coming Soon:
- **Markdown Task Storage:**  
  Store and manage tasks directly within `.md` files, while maintaining database syncing.
  
- **Note-Taking Integration:**  
  Seamless linking between tasks and notes, allowing for context-rich task management.
  
- **Advanced Querying & Reporting:**  
  Powerful search and reporting functionalities, with filters for due dates, priorities, and tags.
